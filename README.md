## 🧩 Problem Categories

- Arrays
- Strings
- Trees & Graphs
- Binary Search
- Dynamic Programming
- Recursion & Backtracking
- Math & Bit Manipulation

---

## ✍️ Solution Format

Each problem includes:

- `solution.js`: Complete implementation in plain JavaScript (without built-in helpers unless specified)
- `README.md`: Summary, input/output example, time and space complexity

---

## ✅ Example

**Directory:**

/strings/string-to-integer-atoi/

**Contents:**

- `solution.js` → implementation of `myAtoi`
- `README.md` → explanation of algorithm, complexity, and input/output

---

## ⚙️ Language & Constraints

- Language: **JavaScript (ES6+)**
- Constraint: No use of built-in parsing or utility functions unless explicitly allowed

---

## 📌 Goal

Maintain a curated and organized collection of high-quality algorithm solutions, useful for interviews, system design, and foundational logic.
